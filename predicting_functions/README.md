# sin_function.ipynb
  Using a neural network with two dense layers, predict sin(x) from -PI * 2 to PI * 2<br>
  This architecture wouldn't work for arbitrary x, but it does pretty well on the range that it was trained on<br>
# TODO
  Try to improve upon the first notebook, using classes and optimizers<br>
  Create a neural network that can take any x from -inf to inf and correctly predict sin(x)<br>
