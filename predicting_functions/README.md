  *sin_function.ipynb*
  Using a neural network with two dense layers, predict sin(x) from -PI * 2 to PI * 2
  This architecture wouldn't work for arbitrary x, but it does pretty well on the range that it was trained on 
  **TODO** 
  Try to improve upon the first notebook, using classes and optimizers
  Create a neural network that can take any x from -inf to inf and correctly predict sin
